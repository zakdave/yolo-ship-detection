## Objective

Implementing YOLOv3 object detection on nautical vessels of varying type, size and perspective and determine whether the classification for “boat,” as described by YOLOv3, is an accurate classification of a broad category. Additionally, an automated image collection solution for testing data against the object identification algorithm will be used. This effectively sets the ground work to create a custom data set and train YOLOv3 to identify objects without prior classification.

## Background & Significance

Exploring the bounds of the “boat” classification from Microsoft COCO (Common Objects in Context) helps future research understand how and why images of boats are classified as boats and how YOLOv3 input parameters affect detection accuracy. 

Understanding the specifics of object detection and the classification of images is an important first step to developing a custom dataset to train YOLOv3 on any object of choosin
